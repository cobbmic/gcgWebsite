  <h3>Keynote Descriptions</h3>
  <p><strong>Friday Night -- <em>The Omnisphere</em></strong><br />
    The sphere of god's mission is everywhere and everything. God is in everything, and everything is in God. This is panentheism ("God is in everything"), which is fundamentally different than pantheism ("everything is God"). The <em>Omnisphere</em> is God's arena of presence and influence in which we have been invited to live and move and have our being. This is both exciting and inviting. The possibilities of joining God in his mission are endless.</p>
  <p><strong>Saturday Morning -- <em>The Xenosphere</em></strong><br />
   When we join God in his mission, we will meet new and different people every day.  Being on mission with God means being introduced to everyone God wants to meet! Since Xenos is the Greek word for stranger, this could be called the Xenosphere. Not everyone would be classified clinically as Xenophobic who struggles to meet or interact with strangers. This is a common human challenge. But loving strangers and showing hospitality to others is the heart of God’s mission. We cannot join God in his mission unless we are equipped to effectively and enjoyably meet new people and open the door for relationships to flourish. When we join God in his mission, it is not always a question of where, but it is always a question of who.</p>
  <p><strong>Saturday Evening -- <em>The Agapesphere</em></strong><br />
    Let’s face it, “hooking up” is not normally a Christian way of talking about relationships. But rather than running from this, let’s address the elephant in the room. And let’s get this right. The vast majority of college students are looking to take their relationships to another level. They instinctively feel the desire to add relationships of intimacy to the kinds of relationships we grew up with. We still want friends, teammates, co-workers and family, but we want more. We want intimate friends, intimate brothers and sisters, and perhaps even a spouse. But navigating relationships like this is like walking through a minefield. It is like the drive to initiate and build intimate relationships can ruin the rest of our lives. This is NOT what we want, nor does it have to be this way. The real issue could be that we are getting the wrong kind of love out front. Quite often, as we are exploring these relationships, other relationships suffer. We do not want to give up on these kinds of relationships, but the whole exercise can be so risky. Augustine addressed the challenge of our impulses, drives, and passions. He addressed the reality that the same passions that drive us to God can also lead us into sin. He wrote about all sin as “disordered love.” We have to get the right kind of love out in the lead of these relationships.</p>
  <p><strong>Sunday Morning -- <em>The Symbiosphere</em></strong><br />
    How do we develop a sphere of life instead of a sphere of death. How do we come around the table (1 Corinthians 10-12)? How do we think about this? We encourage the change within that person toward the community. How can they bring about the change they desire to see in the community? We thrive in the “mean girl’s club” because we are not on the mean end of it. But what about when we get older and actually need all the people we have rejected? Do we simply use them and throw them away? Remember that people are simply complex. We are called to create communities crystallized around Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p><strong>Sunday Evening -- <em>Glocalsphere</em></strong><br />
   This word is not unique to me, but Glocalization means we are equipped for local and global mission. On a university campus, our local and global mission come together. This is a unique setting in which people choose to come together to learn, and we have the opportunity to reach the world by walking across campus or across the hall. This influences the way relationships develop and the openness of sharing ideas. There are challenges unique to 2019 that require equipping. Social media allows this generation the opportunity to know the world differently than any preceding generation, but this can also create barriers as people seek to maintain their localized sense of identity in a globalized world.</p>

  <h3>Breakout Descriptions</h3>
  <p><strong>Saturday</strong><br />
    <em>Taizé Worship</em><br />
The worship style of Taizé comes from an ecumenical monastery located in Taizé, France. It is simple worship that's designed to be a meditative prayer with no beginning or end. It consists of simple songs, scripture reading, and silence. Brother John, a Taizé monk, describes it this way, "It is a time to rest in God, to let the words listened to and sung penetrate one's being."<br />
<br />
<em>Joshua Solowey, "The Theology of Missional Living"</em><br />
God is a sending God. From creation until today, we will take a look at the sending nature of God.<br />
<br />
<em>Chris Buxton, "Stress Less"</em><br />
College students in 2019 struggle with stress, worry, and anxiety more than any generation of college students who have come before them. But God wants something very different for you. This class will help you understand God's perspective on stress, worry, anxiety, and fear and give you steps to move past these self-destructive thought patterns.<br />
<br />
<em>Chris Buxton, "Christianity 101"</em><br />
If you are not yet a Christian, if you're a brand new Christian, if you're a believer who would just like to get a deeper understanding of the basics of the Christian faith, or if you understand the faith but need a better structure for explaining it to tohers, this class is for you.<br />
<br />
<em>René Waldrop, "Transformed By Love"</em><br />
René is a former attorney who now works full-time as the Director of By Our Love Ministries, a ministry devoted to loving and serving the children of the Ridgecrest Community in Auburn, Alabama. In her class, she will share her inspiring story. Her story will serve as an example for you of how the Love of God transformed her life and is now transforming a community.</p>

  <p><strong>Sunday</strong><br />
<em>Instrumental Worship</em><br />
Join our band for an hour of worship.<br />
<br />
<em>Joshua Solowey, "The Practice of Missional Living"</em><br />
Living on mission is all too easy to leave in the discussion phase. Let's get practical. How do we actually practice this in our local contexts?<br />
<br />
<em>Trey Hayes, "The Truth about Pornography"</em><br />
An honest, informative, and “non-guilt-trippy” discussion about pornography and its effects on our physical, mental, and spiritual relationships. This class will equip you to lead someone—maybe yourself, maybe not—out of addiction.<br />
<br />
<em>Kevin Wooten, "Give Me a Map!: Making Important Decisions"</em><br />
Who wouldn't like to know exactly what God wants from you? What degree to pursue; who to marry; where to live. We can be paralyzed and overwhelmed in seeking what God wants from us. Attend Kevin Wooten's class to find out a better way to go about seeking the "will of God" for your life.</p>
